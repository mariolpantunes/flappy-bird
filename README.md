# Learn to fly using neural evolution

In this work, we will learn to fly using neural evolution.
That means teaching a neural network to play a simplified version of the well-known flappy bird.
Given the nature of the game itself, it is not easy to train a neural network in a conventional way (using a curated dataset, and a guided optimization based on the gradient).
We will instead on different methods that explore the usage of reinforcement learning and genetic optimization to train consecutive improved versions of our model.
