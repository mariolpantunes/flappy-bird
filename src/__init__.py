In this work, we will learn to fly using neural evolution.
That means teaching a neural network to play a simplified
version of the well-known flappy bird.
Given the nature of the game itself, it is not easy to 
train a neural network in a conventional way (using a 
curated dataset, and a guided optimization based on the 
gradient).
We will instead on different methods that explore the 
usage of reinforcement learning and genetic optimization 
to train consecutive improved versions of our model.
